            <h1 class="margin text-center">The movie webpage project</h1>
            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p> The title for this project is called "Different". This project involved creating a movie web page. This allowed us to bring ideas and creativity into a webpage. 
            This helped bring out the learning skills that we learned for HTML and CSS. So my partner Emely wanted to make an action movie. But it wasn't an interesting
            movie and wasn't really aspiring to be so. We decided that we weren't gonna stay with the first idea, so we switched up last minute to a movie that was connected to our ideas, combined and mixed up with inspiration
            from our favorite shows.</p>
            <h2>Content</h2>
            <p>So Emely and I made a movie web page about two crystalloid twins. Basically, one twin was good and one twin was bad. My partner and divided the work equally and made a plan. To summarize our story, the bad twin ends up destroying the city because of how humans have treated their species, and so the good twin, who is peaceful, ends up wrongly blamed. That caused
            a very escalated conflict between them and humans. </p>
            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>Some challenges my friend and I faced at first were whether this idea was good for the project, and so, because of that, it was challenging because we had to kind of restart
            and make another idea. What's nice is that we both got it done, and especially the extra credit one, so yay :D. Another challenge was how we were going to format everything, images and text were very indecisive and difficult.</p>
            <p>What I would like to take away from this project is that it's better to have more than one idea, so if I end up changing my mind, I already have a selection of different ideas
            I have brainstormed. </p>
            <p>For my next steps, I would've changed the fonts and color. I should've done like this color that symbolized half the good and bad side, representing the 2 characters.
            But as a main priority, it was to get this done. So I would like to use this knowledge and takeaways I've learned from this experience to use them if we have another similar project like this to become better.</p>
